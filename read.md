build me Google script web app for mobile application. I want to input fields and on my phone load tip values. Here it is Tip calculator, we split total tip pool based on the hours we work at the bar. Allow me to input the name and start and end time of each person. Let me also calculate the tips by inputting the quantity of each denomination in the cash tip pool. Then when I calculate the tips. Show the total hours worked, the tips / hour then multiply tips per hour out to each person by their hours (rounding down to nearest dollar) then in a receipt visual show the data points like total tips, tips /hour and so on . Show individually each persons tips with subtle multiplication on that row showing how it got solved. Sum up all people and show remainder $ if there are any for occurrences that rounding causes that.
